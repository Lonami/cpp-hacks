cpp-hacks
=========

just a few "hacks" written in c++; not the best code in the world.
despite the real use, the code in utils/input/make may be helpful
for others if you want to know:

* query and emulate mouse and keyboard input
* compile stuff with clang in windows
* force the executable to be ran as admin

if you hate bad c++, please make a pull request and i'll gladly merge.
compiling is done by running make.bat because not using actual makefiles
also yes that bat file could be better by checking error codes etc. etc.

pathofexile.com is a fun game to play in hardcore, but dying is tough, so this
code just aids setting a key you can use to fast disconnect when in trouble...
